# Mini Redis Client

Very simple and straightforward C++ client to access Redis, and Redis publisher/subscriber. 


In my opinion, most existing C++ wrappers are over engineering. 


Providing wrapper for most common Redis commands, and also providing the raw interface to execute other commands not wrapped. 


Depends on hiredis. 

And for subscriber, depends on extra lib of libevent.
