# MiniRedisClient

Very simple and straightforward C++ client to access Redis. 


In my opinion, most existing C++ wrappers are over engineering. 


Providing wrapper for most common Redis commands, and also providing the raw interface to execute other commands not wrapped. 


Depends on hiredis only.
